### Coolant

Trouble shooting:

 - [ ] Is fill level high enough?
 - [ ] Is motor running freely (should be able to spin shaft easily). If not, impellor in bottom assembly might need to be cleaned.
 - [ ] Is coolant returning to the tank

Health check
    1. How quickly does 250g of coolant return to the tank? (Measure by putting bucket in front of tank), and pouring coolant into bed.)
    2. What rate does the coolant pump when the tank is full?
    3. Can the pump maintain that flow rate when the tank is kept topped up?
    4. How much does the flow rate slow when the tank depletes?
    4. At what fill level does the pump stop?
